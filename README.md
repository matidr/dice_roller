# 🎲 Dice Roller - My First Flutter App

## 📌 Project Overview

This is a simple Dice Roller application built using the **Flutter** framework. The project represents my first hands-on experience with Flutter and was created as a learning exercise. As an experienced native Android developer, my goal was to explore Flutter’s reactive UI paradigm, widget-based architecture, and the **Dart** programming language.

## ✨ Features

- **Roll the Dice**  
  Tap a button to generate a random number from 1 to 6.

- **Dynamic Visuals**  
  The dice image updates in real time based on the rolled number.

- **Interactive Design**  
  A clean, minimal interface showcasing core Flutter UI principles.

## 🚀 My Flutter Learning Journey

Transitioning from native Android to Flutter was an exciting and insightful experience. Here are some of my key takeaways:

- **🔥 Hot Reload & Hot Restart**  
  Rapid iteration dramatically improved my development workflow and made debugging much faster.

- **🧱 Declarative UI**  
  The widget-based system was intuitive after adjusting to the mental shift from imperative UI design.

- **💬 Dart Language**  
  Dart was surprisingly enjoyable—concise, strongly typed, and purpose-built for Flutter.

- **🌐 Cross-Platform Potential**  
  Even with this simple app, the power of a single codebase for multiple platforms is impressive and motivating.

### Core Concepts Practiced

- Setting up a new Flutter project
- Understanding `MaterialApp` and `Scaffold`
- Using layout widgets like `Column` and `Center`
- Handling user input with `ElevatedButton`
- Managing state to update UI dynamically (e.g., `setState`)
- Incorporating images with `Image.asset`

I'm excited to build on this foundation and explore more advanced Flutter capabilities!
